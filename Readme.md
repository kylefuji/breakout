# Breakout

This is game 2 of the 20 games challenge. This took me approx. 6ish hours to make. It has menu, sounds, and a way to persist the high score across playthroughs. This was less about having physics and logic, and it's more about learning the Godot specific things like adding a menu, sounds, and saving data. 

The source code and assets were all created ny me, and is CC0 and available for anyone to look at and use.
